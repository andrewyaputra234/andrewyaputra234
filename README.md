Hi there, I'm a student of Applied Computing üëã
I'm currently a student studying applied computing with a specialization in fintech. I'm exploring the exciting world of AI and how it can be integrated into everyday applications. This journey helps me learn more about web development and improve my overall programming skills. With the rise of AI, I'm passionate about creating applications that bring the power of AI to our daily lives.

I am also an online seller of trading cards. I've had a problem with displaying my sales to customers, so I've decided to create an app that uses AI to help me sell more easily.

My First Project: TripTracker Expense üó∫Ô∏è
TripTracker Expense is my first step in this journey‚Äîa web-based application designed to help users manage their travel budgets effectively. It allows travelers to track expenses, visualize spending patterns, and receive AI-powered recommendations to optimize their budgets. The app focuses on real-time expense tracking and intelligent suggestions to improve financial decision-making during trips.

AI Recommendations: Receive AI-generated suggestions for optimizing trip spending and personalized budget tips based on past expense patterns.

Data Handling: Fetches and displays JSON data with real-time updates without a page reload.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Charting: Chart.js with date-fns adapter for date parsing

Backend: Node.js / Express (if applicable)

AI Integration: OpenAI API for recommendation generation

Data Storage: JSON files or API endpoint

My Second Project: One Piece TCG Expense Tracker üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to help One Piece Card Game players and sellers like myself track and manage card collections and associated expenses. As an online seller, I found it difficult to automate the data needed to display my sales, so I wanted to explore how I could integrate AI to make the process easier. This app helps me automate data display to streamline my sales.
